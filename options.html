    PassableChrome is an extension that allows you to generate highly secure
    passwords.<p/>

    You put in a long secret phrase that doesn't change.<p/>

    For each site, you put in a short unique nickname. It should be something
    easy for you to remember.<p/>

    You can generate passwords in lengths of 40, 28, 20 or 14 characters.
    While it would be ideal and most secure to always use 40 characters, some
    websites have length limits or pattern requirements. The 40 and 20
    character length passwords are all lower case and use only the numbers
    0-9 and the letters a-f. The 28 and 14 character length passwords are a
    mix of uppercase and lowercase and use the full spectrum of ascii numbers,
    letters, and symbols.<p/>

    NOTE: None of the information in the secret, nickname, or password fields
    is ever stored to your local disk or anywhere on the Internet. You have
    the option of keeping the secret in your browser's private memory area for
    convenience.<p/>
